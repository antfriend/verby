  This device will, in effect, say your mantra for you.
  It can be used to develop a deep meditative state.

  TO USE:

  strap the device at a comfortable position on your belly.
  It is better to be around the top of the belly than below 
  the bellybutton.  Inflate the air bladder to be full but
  still squishy.

  Turn it on.  Take a deep breath.  You should see the
  bar graph rise fully to the top of your inhale and
  decline fully at the bottom of your exhale.  If the
  device is correctly adjusted, your breathing should not
  be restricted.  Adjust as needed.  The device can be
  quite loose, with a very softly inflated air bladder.
  It will function equally well if it is uncomfortably
  tight, with a firm air bladder.  The important thing
  is to make it comfortable and unrestrictive.
   
  This device will not force a meditative state, it
  will encourage the development of a deep meditative state
  if the user wants to develop a meditative state.
  Our bodies already know how to meditate.  Just as we
  can go to sleep each night and wake up each morning,
  we can meditate daily.  What we must learn, is how
  tell our bodies that right now, at this time, we want to
  go into a meditative state.

  Once you've done it, subsequent attempts succeed with
  increasing ease.

  If you have not already learned to meditate, this
  device will teach you, upon repeated usage, how to
  meditate on your own, without the device.  This goal
  is accomplished through the way the device models chanting
  a mantra to your own breathing.  

  The device may also serve to assist in achieving a mentally
  and physically beneficial meditative state under even
  less condusive environmental or situational contexts.

  The performance benefits of meditation prior to many mental or
  physical tasks are well documented.

  The long-term physiological and psychological benefits of a
  practice of daily meditation are well documented in hundreds
  of peer-reviewed scientific papers.  The American Medical
  Association recommends meditation as a first response treatment
  for high blood pressure.

  Learning to effectively meditate is like learning to swim; it
  is difficult to do from reading about it.  It is best done
  through training, but training is expensive and requires
  a lot of one on one time.

  Using real-time biofeedback on your breathing volume and rate,
  this device models effective mantra chanting.  Chants incorporate
  theta-level brainwave entrainment via frequency modulation.
  Optional "eye phones" can provide more captivating entrainment for
  people who can tolerate blinking lights.

  Most suited to a hospital or field hospital setting where people
  are less conscious of
